         <h2>Wrestling:</h2>
           <p>Wrestling is something I enjoy very much. I wrestled with year, freshman year and for a first year wrestler with only a little bit of background in wrestling, I did pretty good. I can't really remember what my record was but all I remember is I had a positive record. I competed of varsity when we had duals, trianglers, and quads. I loved the look of all the upperclassmen after I beat them. It is a lot of work and very tiring but it is all worth it in the end. I went to the varsity city championship and since I worked really hard throughout the season and because of this I was doing really until I got injured. It was just a very fun season overall.</p>
         <br>
         <h2>Video Games:</h2>
            <p>To begin with, I am an avid gamer. I game almost on a daily and that is what i'll do in my free time most of the time. I own a PS4 and a couple of my favorite video games at the moment are Fortnite Battle Royale, Overwatch, and Titan Fall 2. I've been playing video games like my entire life and it is something I enjoy very very much. My first video game console was the PS2 and it was so cool, my dad would trick and give me the unplugged controller and I would think I would be playing it, but when this happened I was like 3 years old. My second vidoe game console was the Xbox 360. We got it when we moved into my house and I thought it was amazing. I was at the age where I knew how to play these games and it was so fun. Me and my brother</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Exercising:</h2>
            <p>I enjoy exercising very much. It just like to keep my body in a clean and strong state and that's one of the reasons I exercise. I will run, do sports, push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups, etc. I would want to start going to the gym again over the summer because right now it is a little hard because of wrestling at the moment. I do wreslting year round and i am about to do it again to get better. Exercising in general is just a healthy thing to do and it's enjoyable also. Exercising can be in many different ways to excerise. One way can just be walking, it's better than just sitting at home on the couch watching tv. You could play a game outside with your friends, playing a sport, doing push-ups at your home, etc. You can just think and do it.</p>

                    <h2>Early Life:</h2>
                    <p>When I was younger, my family lives in a pretty small apartment. It was okay at the time because me and my brother we still very small and we owned a very small dog. My pre-school was called kidwatch and it was pretty cool, I had friends there and they made the time fun. I met one of my bestfriends still to this there. I have known him since I was 3. My cousins would come over and we would be staying in the living room playing video games and watching Cartoon. I would remember waking up on the weekends and waking my parents up so they could turn to cartoon Network. That was the life.</p>
                    <h2>After the Move:</h2>
                    <p>When I was about six years old we moved to a house and I remember it being a very important part of my life. I had already started kindergarden and from the apartment it was really far but this new house was really close. It was just very easy. And when I was about eight years old, my dad signed me and my brother up from jiu-jitsu. This was a huge aspect of my life. I did that for about six years and I enjoyed it very much. I didn't compete very much but I still worked my hardest. While I was doing that I started doing boxing, wrestling, and muy thai. Jiu-jitsu was my main sport at the time but I still enjoyed all the rest. I started to do them less though because the gym I was doing it at moved and it started being really bad. Then I went to a new gym and that where I continued for about a year. I stopped recently in the summer because I would be going on vacation over then summer. And since I had gotten into my dream high school aka Lane Tech, I wouldn't be doing it then either because I would be doing wreslting and I am going to be doing that year round. Freshman year so far has been really enjotable and all the people I met have made a great impact on my life in many ways.</p>

                        <p>One of my all time life goals is to be in the marines. I want to got to college but after that I want to go to the military. My father was in the marines and that is one of the reasons for me wanting to go to the marines. I knwo it will be hard work, but I will push through it. I am going to wokr as hard as I can to do it. I want to go to college and possibly wrestle if I can get a scholar ship or if I am good enough to be a walk on. I just want to be sucessful person in life, I think I can and I am going to work really hard towards it.</p>

               <p>A couple of my achievements are getting into Lane Tech High School, doing very well on the wrestling team, and getting good grades.</p>
               <h2>Lane Tech:</h2>
               <p>Getting into Lane Tech is one of my most memorable achievements because it was is my dream highschool. I went to go to Lane Tech and so I worked really hard and focused in school. I was very proud of myself and my family was also very proud of me. I still think Lane Tech is the school for me because I have met so many great people at lane, I enjoy playing the sports at lane, there are some cool and chill teachers, and it is just a great school in my opinion.</p>
               <h2>Wrestling:</h2>
               <p>This is also one of my achievements because as a first year wrestler, I feel like I did well. I wrestled on varsity a couple times, and I also did well then. I competed in the varisty city tournement and I was doing really well until I got injured and couldn't continue, but that doesn't stop me, I am still going to wrestle.</p>
                <h2>Grades:</h2>
                <p>My grades are pretty good for highschool. My elementary school didn't really prepare me for highschool and for only have 2 B's (which were 88 and 89) I felt really proud and my family did too.</p>

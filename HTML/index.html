         <h2>Wrestling:</h2>
           <p>Wrestling is something I enjoy very much. I wrestled with year, freshman year and for a first year wrestler with only a little bit of background in wrestling, I did pretty good. I can't really remember what my record was but all I remember is I had a positive record. I competed of varsity when we had duals, trianglers, and quads. I loved the look of all the upperclassmen after I beat them. It is a lot of work and very tiring but it is all worth it in the end. I went to the varsity city championship and since I worked really hard throughout the season and because of this I was doing really until I got injured. It was just a very fun season overall.</p>
         <br>
         <h2>Video Games:</h2>
            <p>To begin with, I am an avid gamer. I game almost on a daily and that is what i'll do in my free time most of the time. I own a PS4 and a couple of my favorite video games at the moment are Fortnite Battle Royale, Overwatch, and Titan Fall 2. I've been playing video games like my entire life and it is something I enjoy very very much. My first video game console was the PS2 and it was so cool, my dad would trick and give me the unplugged controller and I would think I would be playing it, but when this happened I was like 3 years old. My second vidoe game console was the Xbox 360. We got it when we moved into my house and I thought it was amazing. I was at the age where I knew how to play these games and it was so fun. Me and my brother</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Exercising:</h2>
            <p>I enjoy exercising very much. It just like to keep my body in a clean and strong state and that's one of the reasons I exercise. I will run, do sports, push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups, etc. I would want to start going to the gym again over the summer because right now it is a little hard because of wrestling at the moment. I do wreslting year round and i am about to do it again to get better. Exercising in general is just a healthy thing to do and it's enjoyable also.</p>
